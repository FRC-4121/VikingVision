# Configuration Files

Configuration files describe the overall structure of your program—what cameras should be loaded, what components to use, and how they connect to each other. The rest of the documentation details everything that can go in the file, along with what fields it's looking for.

In order for a configuration to be useful, there should be at least one [camera](../cameras/overview.md) and at least one [component](../components/overview.md). The cameras are the inputs to the program, and components handle processing and presentation.

In addition to cameras and components, configuration files can have [run parameters](run.md), [NetworkTables](ntable.md), and [vision debugging](debug.md) configured. More information about each of this is available in their respective sections.
